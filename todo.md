- support for map ?

- when there are multiple varibles, get subset based on an assuming that some variables are fixed.

for example: i ∈ [1, ..., 3], for all j ∈ [1, ..., i], f(j) > 0

i = 1, j ∈ [1], f(1) > 0,
i = 2, j ∈ [1, 2], f(1) > 0, f(2) > 0,
i = 3, j ∈ [1, 2, 3], f(1) > 0, f(2) > 0, f(3) > 0

[1, ..., i] is a dynamic set

- support eq interface

## done

- support belong to variable
